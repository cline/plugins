description: Build and manage M&A Virtual Data Rooms with Box MCP - create secure folder structures with numbered prefixes for due diligence, assign role-based access to internal teams and external parties (counsel, auditors, buyers), validate permissions before sharing sensitive deal information, use Box AI for cross-document due diligence questions, and organize uploaded files by category. Use this skill when the user mentions M&A, deal rooms, data rooms, due diligence, VDR, mergers and acquisitions, or needs to set up a secure repository for deal documents with controlled external access.

# M&A Deal Room Management

> PREREQUISITES:
> - Read the bundled `box` skill for Box MCP auth, tool selection, and base workflows. If it is unavailable, install or enable the `box` Cline plugin; do not run external skill installers from this workflow.
> - Read `box-legal-workflows` for risk frameworks, confidentiality, human-in-the-loop requirements, Box AI governance. If missing, ensure it's installed from the same skill package.

M&A Virtual Data Rooms require strict access controls, organized folder structures, and audit trails. This skill guides deal room creation, role-based permissions, and Box AI due diligence.

Core principles: Need-to-know access, audit readiness, compartmentalization, validation before sharing.

## Permission Architecture

### Internal Roles
| Role | Access Level | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Deal Lead / M&A Team | Editor or Co-Owner | Root folder |
| Finance Team | Viewer | Financial Statements folder only |
| Legal Team | Editor | Legal Documents folder only |
| Executive Stakeholders | Viewer | Root folder (read-only overview) |

### External Roles

[CONFIRM WITH USER: External permissions]
Before granting external access, confirm:
- Permission level? (Upload-Only, Viewer, Editor)
- Which folders? (entire deal room or specific folders)
- Expiration date?
- Shared link or direct collaboration?

Common patterns:
- External Counsel: Uploader on "External Counsel" folder (can upload, can't see others' files)
- Auditors: Viewer on Financial Statements folder only
- Prospective Buyer: Viewer on curated subset (not full deal room)

Always confirm before:
- Granting Editor/Co-Owner to external parties
- Creating Open shared links
- Granting root folder access outside core team

---

## Standard Folder Structure

[CONFIRM: Folder structure]
Before creating, confirm:
- Organization has standard M&A template?
- Additional categories? (Environmental, Insurance)
- Folders to omit?

Standard structure:
```
[Deal Name] M&A Deal Room/
├── 01 - Financial Statements/
│   ├── Annual Reports/
│   ├── Quarterly Reports/
│   ├── Audited Financials/
│   └── Tax Returns/
├── 02 - Legal Documents/
│   ├── Corporate Documents/
│   ├── Material Contracts/
│   ├── Litigation/
│   └── Regulatory Filings/
├── 03 - HR & Employment/
├── 04 - Intellectual Property/
├── 05 - Commercial Contracts/
├── 06 - Real Estate & Assets/
├── 07 - IT & Cybersecurity/
└── 08 - External Submissions/
```

Why numbered prefixes: Consistent ordering across users, matches DD checklists, practice area alignment, segregates external submissions.

## Tool Selection

| Task | Primary Tool | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Create folders | CONFIRM, then `create_folder` | Batch create hierarchy |
| Upload new files | CONFIRM, then `upload_file` | For new documents |
| Copy from Box | CONFIRM, then `copy_file` | Copy existing Box files |
| Grant internal access | CONFIRM, then `create_collaboration` | Viewer/Editor/Co-Owner |
| Grant external access | CONFIRM, then `create_collaboration` | Always confirm first |
| Validate permissions | `list_item_collaborations` | Audit before sharing |
| Search documents | `search_files_keyword` | Find relevant docs |
| DD Q&A | `ai_qa_multi_file` | Cross-document analysis |
| Extract terms | `ai_extract_structured_from_fields_enhanced` | High accuracy extraction |
| Organize files | CONFIRM, then `copy_file` | Copy submissions to categories |

---

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Deal Room Setup
1. Authenticate: `who_am_i`
2. [CONFIRM: Create root folder?] `create_folder` with deal name
3. Create subfolders: [CONFIRM: Customize?] → batch create
4. Grant internal access: [CONFIRM: Emails and roles?] → `create_collaboration`

### Phase 2: Content Upload & Organization
5. Upload/copy: [CONFIRM: Source?] → `upload_file` or `copy_file`
6. Organize submissions: `get_file_details` → `ai_qa_single_file` (classify) → [CONFIRM: Copy files into categories?] `copy_file`

### Phase 3: External Access & Sharing
7. Audit permissions: `list_item_collaborations` (before external sharing)
8. Grant external access: [CONFIRM: Who, folders, permission, expiration?] → `create_collaboration` or `add_folder_shared_link`
9. Verify: `list_item_collaborations` (confirm correct)

### Phase 4: Due Diligence & Analysis
10. Answer DD questions: `search_files_keyword` → `ai_qa_multi_file` → surface citations
11. Extract terms: [CONFIRM: Fields?] → `ai_extract_structured_from_fields_enhanced`
12. Write metadata: [CONFIRM: Template exists and write approved?] → `set_file_metadata`

## Guardrails

See box-legal-workflows for: Human-in-the-loop requirements, confidentiality, Box AI governance.

M&A-specific:

ALWAYS confirm before:
1. External access grants (any external party)
2. Creating shared links (especially Open)
3. Creating initial folder structure (default template vs. custom)
4. Copying files to externally-accessible folders (if file was NOT already externally accessible)

CONFIRM if uncertain:
5. Risk assessment decisions (if factors are ambiguous)
6. Metadata field selection (if unclear which fields are needed)
7. File categorization (if document type is unclear)

May draft without additional confirmation when confident:
- Categorizing documents by type as a proposed plan.
- Extracting terms from financial or legal documents into the conversation or a draft.
- Drafting due diligence summary reports for user review.
- Recommending metadata values, file organization, or access changes without applying them.

Any Box write requires explicit confirmation first, including metadata updates, uploaded summaries, folder creation, collaborations, shared links, comments, or moving/copying files.

Default behaviors:
- Default to Viewer for external parties
- Prefer folder-specific over root access
- Validate with `list_item_collaborations` before external links
- Pace Box AI calls 1-2 seconds apart
- Surface citations from Box AI

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Create Deal Room + Internal Access
Request: "Create M&A deal room for Project Thunder, give Sarah editor access, John viewer access."

Flow:
1. `who_am_i`
2. [CONFIRM]: "Standard M&A structure? Customize?"
3. [CONFIRM: Create root and subfolders?] `create_folder` (root + all subfolders)
4. [CONFIRM]: "Grant Sarah Editor, John Viewer on root?"
5. `create_collaboration` (both)
6. `list_item_collaborations` (verify)
7. Report: folder IDs, access summary

### Example 2: External Counsel Upload Access
Request: "Give external law firm upload access to Legal Documents."

Flow:
1. [CONFIRM]: "Email? Upload-Only or Editor? Expiration? Which folder?"
2. `list_item_collaborations` (audit current)
3. [CONFIRM: Grant this access?] `create_collaboration` (with confirmed params)
4. Verify and report

### Example 3: DD Question
Request: "What was EBITDA for last 3 years?"

Flow:
1. `search_files_keyword` ("EBITDA", Financial Statements folder)
2. Identify annual reports (last 3 years)
3. `ai_qa_multi_file` (specific question)
4. Present answer with citations
5. Offer additional metrics extraction

### Example 4: Permission Audit
Request: "Check who has access before sharing with buyer's team."

Flow:
1. `list_item_collaborations` (root)
2. Categorize internal vs. external
3. Present audit report
4. [CONFIRM]: "Buyer's team access: folders? permission? expiration?"
5. Wait for confirmation
