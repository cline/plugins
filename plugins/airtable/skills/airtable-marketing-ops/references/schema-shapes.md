# Schema shapes for airtable-marketing-ops scaffolding

Field-by-field detail for the schema shapes named in `SKILL.md`. Load the section that matches the scope answers; don't read the whole file.

Each shape comes in four variants -- B2B (named accounts, ABM motions if relevant), consumer / DTC (cohorts and segments, lifecycle stages, app-store / channel-source ingestion), mixed / B2B2C (both), and agency (multi-client, retainer drawdown, client portal). The base structure is the same across variants; the variants add specific tables and fields. Pick the variant from the third scope question (audience shape) plus the optional agency branch.

Two cross-cutting notes that apply across every shape:

-   AI fields are a native typed-field capability -- use them on any table that benefits from per-record AI output (categorization on Requests, expansion on Briefs, tagging on Assets, narrative summaries on Performance / Budget / Approvals, translation on locale-variants). Configurations and tier-gating evolve; check `support.airtable.com` for current AI-field capabilities before scaffolding. Each AI field below pairs with a human-review gate per the copilot pattern described in `references/sub-workflows.md`.
-   Match the schema to the native view / Interface component it scaffolds. Kanban needs a singleSelect (or single-link or collaborator) for stacking. Calendar needs a date field. Gallery wants an Attachment field as the cover. Timeline needs Start (and optionally End) dates. Gantt needs a self-linking linked-record on the work-items table for dependencies (FS-only); end-date-only records render as milestones. Form view doesn't surface computed fields and can't create new linked-records inline. For current required-field and tier-gating constraints on any native view or Interface component, verify against `support.airtable.com` before scaffolding -- a wrong-shape schema produces a base that won't render the intended view.

## Lightweight tracker (2-3 tables)

For solo marketers, small teams replacing spreadsheets, music release drivers, and book publicity trackers. The dominant SMB shape. Customer language to expect: _"a mess of Excel and Google Sheets calendars,"_ _"replaces manual Excel tracking,"_ _"avoid the cost of [Hootsuite / Sprout],"_ _"team of two with high cognitive load."_ Don't impose multi-tier structure they won't use.

### Tables

-   Campaigns -- the master object.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Idea, In progress, Approved, Live, Done, Won't do) -- color-code red / yellow / blue / green / grey
    -   `Channel` (multipleSelects: Email, Social, Web, Paid, SMS, PR, Event, Other)
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Start date` (date), `End date` (date)
    -   `Brief / description` (multilineText)
    -   `Assets` (multipleAttachments) or `Linked assets` (multipleRecordLinks -> Assets table if one exists)
    -   `Created` (createdTime), `Last updated` (lastModifiedTime)
-   Tasks / Deliverables -- work items per campaign.
    -   `Title` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Campaign` (multipleRecordLinks -> Campaigns)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: To do, In progress, In review, Done, Blocked)
    -   `Assignee` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Due date` (date)
    -   `Notes` (multilineText)
-   Assets (optional third table) -- when there's enough creative work to warrant separating asset versions from campaigns.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Type` (singleSelect: Image, Video, Copy, HTML, Print, Other)
    -   `Campaign` (multipleRecordLinks -> Campaigns)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Draft, In review, Approved, Live)
    -   `File` (multipleAttachments)

### Variants

-   B2B variant -- usually skip; if the team explicitly tracks per-account campaigns, push up to small / mid.
-   Consumer variant -- base shape works as-is; add `Channel source` (singleSelect: iOS / Android / Web / Retail / Other) on Campaigns when relevant.
-   Agency variant -- add `Client` (singleSelect or multipleRecordLinks -> Clients table if more than ~5 clients). For per-client confidentiality, use per-client bases instead of one base with `Client` field.

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Calendar view on Campaigns keyed by Start date or End date -- the most universal hand-off.
-   Form view on Campaigns or Tasks for "marketing request intake" -- even at this scale, intake forms are high-leverage.
-   Filtered grid view: "Active this week" using a formula `IF(AND(Start <= TODAY(), End >= TODAY()), 1, 0)`.
-   Single Interface page summarizing campaigns by status -- leadership-friendly read-only view.

## Solo / small (3-4 tables)

The default starter when the user wants more structure than a lightweight calendar -- Campaigns + Briefs + Performance + (optional) Channels. Covers the dominant small-team needs: what we're running (Campaigns), what we asked creative to build (Briefs), what shipped well (Performance).

### Tables

-   Campaigns -- initiatives across channels.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Now, Next, Later, Live, Done, On hold)
    -   `Goal / objective` (multilineText)
    -   `Channel` (multipleSelects: Email, Social, Web, Paid, SMS, PR, Event, Other)
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Start date` / `End date` (date)
    -   `Budget` (currency)
    -   `Linked briefs` (multipleRecordLinks -> Briefs)
    -   `Linked performance` (multipleRecordLinks -> Performance)
    -   `UTM campaign` (formula -- auto-generates a slug from Name)
-   Briefs -- creative briefs feeding the production pipeline.
    -   `Title` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Campaign` (multipleRecordLinks -> Campaigns)
    -   `Type` (singleSelect: Image / Video / Copy / HTML / Print / Other)
    -   `Audience` (multipleSelects or multipleRecordLinks -> Personas / Cohorts)
    -   `Brief body` (multilineText)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Draft, In review, Approved, In production, Final, Live)
    -   `Owner / requester` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Designer / copy` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Due date` (date)
    -   `Assets` (multipleAttachments)
-   Performance -- measurement / attribution per campaign + channel.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary) -- usually `[Campaign name] - [Channel] - [Period]`
    -   `Campaign` (multipleRecordLinks -> Campaigns)
    -   `Channel` (singleSelect)
    -   `Date` (date)
    -   `Impressions` / `Clicks` / `Conversions` / `Revenue` / `Spend` (number / currency)
    -   `ROAS` (formula = `Revenue / Spend`)
    -   `Notes` (multilineText)
-   Channels (optional fourth table) -- when channel-level KPI baselines matter.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `KPI baseline` (number or text)
    -   `Integration metadata` (singleLineText) -- UTM medium prefix, link to MAP segment, etc.

### Variants

-   B2B -- add an Accounts table (or sync from Salesforce). Add `Account` (multipleRecordLinks -> Accounts) to Performance. Add an ARR rollup on Campaigns (`Total ARR of linked accounts`) for ARR-weighted prioritization.
-   Consumer -- add a Cohorts / Segments table. Add `Cohort` (multipleRecordLinks -> Cohorts) on Campaigns. Replace ARR rollup with `Audience volume` rollup.
-   Mixed (B2B2C) -- both Accounts and Cohorts tables. Performance links to one or the other (or both); campaigns roll up volume AND weighted ARR.
-   Agency -- add a Clients table central. Add `Client` (multipleRecordLinks -> Clients) to Campaigns. Add retainer drawdown formula on Clients (`Hours used vs. hours retained per period`).

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Kanban on Campaigns grouped by Status (Now / Next / Later).
-   Form view on Briefs for "creative brief intake."
-   Calendar view on Campaigns keyed by Start date.
-   Interface page: "Marketing calendar overview" -- read-only Campaigns table filtered to Live + Next, grouped by Channel.
-   Form view on a generic "Marketing request" table feeding Briefs or Campaigns depending on type.

## Mid (5-6 tables)

The 3-4 table shape plus assets, channels, and audience modeling. Approval workflows become first-class; stakeholder-specific interfaces are common. The dominant mid-market shape.

### Tables added on top of the 3-4 table shape

-   Assets -- creative assets / variants, distinct from briefs. This table IS the DAM for moderate asset volumes -- Airtable's Attachment field stores the file, with rich typed metadata around it. The native Asset Review feature supports pixel-perfect annotation directly on image / video attachments; Proofing adds versioning with side-by-side comparison and an annotation toolset across supported document formats. For current plan-tier gates, supported formats, and file-size limits, see `support.airtable.com`. Only push the user toward an external DAM (Bynder / Frontify / Adobe / Cloudinary) at very-high-volume enterprise scale or when they already have one.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Type` (singleSelect: Image / Video / Copy / HTML / Print / Other)
    -   `Brief` (multipleRecordLinks -> Briefs)
    -   `Locale` (singleSelect) -- only when localization matters
    -   `Channel` (multipleSelects)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Draft, In review, Approved, Live, Archived)
    -   `Brand-compliance status` (singleSelect: Pending, Approved, Rejected)
    -   `File` (multipleAttachments) -- the asset itself. Configure the attachment-field format to "Versions" to enable Proofing (each newly uploaded file becomes the next version; supports side-by-side comparison and annotation directly on the attachment). Asset Review provides native pixel-perfect feedback on images / videos. Plan-tier and configuration specifics evolve -- check `support.airtable.com` for current requirements before scaffolding.
    -   `Version` (number) -- the explicit version number, useful for cross-referencing in Approval audit-trail records (Proofing tracks versions implicitly via the attachment field, but an explicit number simplifies downstream rollups)
    -   `Usage rights / license` (multilineText) -- optional, common in regulated and brand-asset-library use cases
    -   `Approved-for-external-use` (checkbox) -- surfaces in any partner / agency portal interface
-   Channels -- execution channels with owners and KPI baselines.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `KPI baseline` (currency or number)
    -   `Integration metadata` (singleLineText) -- MAP segment, social handle, etc.
-   Personas / Cohorts / Segments -- audience modeling (pick one based on B2B vs consumer).
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Description` (multilineText)
    -   `Size` (number) -- for consumer cohorts
    -   `ICP fit` (singleSelect) -- for B2B personas
    -   `Linked campaigns` (multipleRecordLinks -> Campaigns)
    -   `AI persona summary` (AI field) -- synthesizes top concerns + watering-hole channels + recent campaign-engagement signal from linked Performance. Human marketer reviews before using in brief audience sections.
-   Tasks (optional sixth table) -- when day-to-day execution needs its own table separate from Briefs (e.g., creative ops with designer queues).
    -   Title / Assignee / Status / Due date / linked to Brief or Campaign

### Variants

-   B2B -- Personas table central; campaigns roll up `Total ARR impacted` via linked Performance -> Accounts. Add `Funnel stage` (singleSelect: TOFU / MOFU / BOFU) on Campaigns.
-   Consumer -- Cohorts table central; campaigns roll up `Audience volume` and `Sentiment distribution.` Add `Lifecycle stage` (singleSelect: New / Active / At-risk / Churned) on Cohorts.
-   Mixed -- both Personas and Cohorts; campaigns can link to either.
-   Agency -- Personas / Cohorts per client; Clients table central; SOWs and deliverables. Per-stage SLA timing.

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Calendar view on Campaigns keyed by Start date, color-coded by Channel.
-   Kanban on Briefs grouped by Status (the creative-ops board).
-   Interface page: "Marketing leadership view" -- Campaigns rollup by Status × Channel with KPI summary.
-   Interface page: "Designer queue" -- Tasks or Briefs filtered to current assignee, sorted by Due date.
-   Form view on a Marketing Request table feeding intake (conditional fields by request type).
-   Sync setup wizard -- Slack notification on Brief status change, HubSpot / Marketo sync for campaign metadata.

## Large (canonical 7-8 tables)

The mid shape plus approvals, vendors / agencies, and explicit budget tracking. Stakeholder-specific interfaces multiply (Leadership / MOps / Designer / Agency / Legal). Approvals become an explicit table for audit-trail purposes.

### Tables added on top of the mid shape

-   Approvals -- audit trail for brand / legal / compliance reviews.
    -   `Asset` or `Brief` (multipleRecordLinks)
    -   `Approver` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Decision` (singleSelect: Approved, Rejected, Approved with conditions, Pending)
    -   `Decision date` (date)
    -   `Notes / conditions` (multilineText)
    -   `AI pre-flag` (AI field on the linked Asset / Brief) -- reads asset content + linked Claim Library + Disclaimer Library and surfaces likely issues (unsupported claims, missing disclaimers, claim-locale mismatches). Human reviewer makes the final decision; the pre-flag accelerates by surfacing what to check first.
-   Vendors / Agencies -- external partners producing work.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Type` (singleSelect: Creative agency / Production house / Influencer agency / DAM / MAP / Other)
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator -- internal AM)
    -   `Active` (checkbox)
    -   `Contract end date` (date)
    -   `Linked briefs` / `Linked campaigns` (multipleRecordLinks)
-   Budget -- marketing spend by line item.
    -   `Line item` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Quarter` (singleSelect: 2026.Q1, 2026.Q2, …)
    -   `Campaign` or `Channel` (multipleRecordLinks)
    -   `Planned amount` (currency)
    -   `Committed amount` (currency, often via PO linkage)
    -   `Actual amount` (currency)
    -   `Variance` (formula = `Actual - Planned`)
    -   `Vendor` (multipleRecordLinks -> Vendors)
    -   `AI variance narrative` (AI field) -- synthesizes the variance + linked POs / invoices + program owner notes into a narrative explanation with reallocation suggestions. MOps director reviews before sharing in QBR / CFO briefs.

### Variants

-   B2B -- Accounts central; ARR rollups drive prioritization. Add a Sales Pipeline link if marketing supports specific deals.
-   Consumer -- Cohorts central; add app-store-source / retail-source ingestion via sync.
-   Mixed -- both tables coexist.
-   Agency -- Clients table central with retainer drawdown; per-client interfaces for client review.

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Org-level campaign rollup interface -- Campaigns by Brand × Quarter, filtered to Live + Next.
-   Vendor / agency capacity view -- Vendors with active brief counts.
-   Budget interface -- Budget by Quarter with variance highlights.
-   Approval queue interface -- Approvals filtered by Approver = current user.
-   Cross-base sync configuration -- hand off the sync wizard for Salesforce / HubSpot / Workfront / etc.

## Enterprise / multi-brand portfolio

The large shape plus sub-brand tables, multi-region rollups, PO tracking integrated with finance, and compliance gates. Hub-and-spoke architecture: each brand / region has its own base syncing into a master campaign hub. Capex / opex on Initiatives; multi-currency rollups; locale-aware Approvals.

### Tables added on top of the large shape

-   Sub-brands -- each brand in the portfolio (when applicable).
    -   `Brand name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Region` (singleSelect or multipleSelects)
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator -- brand lead)
    -   `Campaign hub base ID` (URL or text) -- link to that brand's base if separate
    -   `Quarterly campaign volume` (rollup or count)
-   Regions / Locales -- multi-market metadata.
    -   `Locale code` (singleLineText, primary) -- e.g. `en-US`, `fr-FR`
    -   `Country / Region` (singleSelect)
    -   `Currency` (singleSelect)
    -   `Compliance regime` (multipleSelects) -- e.g. GDPR, CCPA, alcohol-advertising rules
    -   `Local owner` (singleCollaborator)
-   POs -- purchase orders for finance integration.
    -   `PO number` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Vendor` (multipleRecordLinks -> Vendors)
    -   `Budget line` (multipleRecordLinks -> Budget)
    -   `Amount` (currency)
    -   `Currency` (singleSelect)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Draft, Submitted, Approved, Invoiced, Paid, Closed)
    -   `Submitted date` / `Approved date` / `Paid date` (date)
-   Compliance gates (optional, regulated industries) -- required reviews per phase.
    -   `Gate name` (singleLineText, primary) -- e.g. `Legal review`, `MLR review`, `Brand compliance`
    -   `Phase` (singleSelect)
    -   `Required for` (multipleSelects: Asset type / Locale / Channel)
    -   `Approver role` (singleSelect)

### Campaign field additions at this tier

-   `Sub-brand` (multipleRecordLinks -> Sub-brands)
-   `Locales` (multipleRecordLinks -> Regions / Locales)
-   `Capex` / `Opex` (currency) -- when business-case finance fields matter
-   `Expected revenue` / `Expected savings` (currency)
-   `ROI` (formula)
-   `Multi-currency rollup` (formula or rollup with currency conversion)

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Multi-brand portfolio rollup interface -- Campaigns by Sub-brand × Quarter, filtered to Live.
-   Multi-region timeline interface -- Campaigns by Locale × Channel.
-   PO reconciliation view -- Budget vs POs vs Actual variance per Quarter.
-   Compliance audit interface -- Approvals filtered by Compliance gate and Phase.
-   Cross-base sync -- each Sub-brand base syncs Campaigns into the master hub.

## Regulated marketing (niche -- surface on demand)

For pharma, alcohol, finance, insurance, healthcare, lottery -- where assets and campaigns go through phased compliance gates with required approvals. Triggered when the user uses _"MLR review,"_ _"compliance gate,"_ _"legal sign-off,"_ _"claim validation,"_ _"audit trail,"_ or regulated-industry signals.

### Tables added on top of the large or enterprise shape

-   Claim library -- approved claims that assets can reference.
    -   `Claim` (multilineText, primary)
    -   `Approved by` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Approved date` (date)
    -   `Expiration date` (date)
    -   `Reference source` (singleLineText)
    -   `Locales` (multipleRecordLinks -> Regions / Locales)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Active, Expired, Withdrawn)
-   Disclaimer library -- required regulatory disclaimers per locale / product / channel.
    -   `Disclaimer text` (multilineText, primary)
    -   `Required for` (multipleSelects: Locale / Channel / Product / Audience)
    -   `Reference regulation` (singleLineText) -- e.g. _"FTC 16 CFR Part 255"_, _"FDA OPDP,"_ _"AGCO."_
    -   `Active` (checkbox)
-   MLR / Compliance reviews -- Medical / Legal / Regulatory review records.
    -   `Asset` (multipleRecordLinks -> Assets)
    -   `Reviewer role` (singleSelect: Medical / Legal / Regulatory / Brand)
    -   `Reviewer` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Decision` (singleSelect)
    -   `Notes` (multilineText)
    -   `Cycle number` (number) -- for multi-round reviews
    -   `AI compliance pre-flag` (AI field on linked Asset) -- same pattern as Approvals: reads asset content + Claim Library + Disclaimer Library + Locale and flags likely issues for human reviewer attention. Heaviest leverage in MLR cycles where reviewers are the explicit bottleneck.

### Asset / Brief field additions

-   `Required claims` (multipleRecordLinks -> Claim library)
-   `Required disclaimers` (multipleRecordLinks -> Disclaimer library)
-   `Compliance status` (formula or rollup over linked MLR reviews)
-   `Locale-specific compliance status` (rollup)

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Compliance review queue interface -- Assets at each phase, sortable by Due date.
-   Claim library audit -- Claims with expiration warnings.
-   Approval audit log -- MLR reviews filtered by Phase or Reviewer.
-   Disclaimer enforcement view -- Assets missing required disclaimers per locale.

## Agency multi-client (niche -- surface on demand)

For agencies, freelancers, and consultancies running marketing for multiple clients. The dominant SMB shape and a meaningful Enterprise shape (in-house agencies). Triggered when the user uses _"clients,"_ _"multi-client,"_ _"retainer,"_ _"agency,"_ _"client portal,"_ or runs marketing for external orgs.

### Schema-choice decision

-   Single base with `Client` field -- most common; easier to manage; cross-client reporting and capacity rollups are simple. Use when client confidentiality is moderate (clients don't see each other but the agency team can).
-   Per-client base -- required when client confidentiality is strict (e.g., NDA-bound brands in the same category -- two competing apparel makers, two competing auto dealers). Heavier to maintain; cross-client capacity reporting requires sync into a central agency hub.

### Tables added on top of the small or mid shape

-   Clients -- each client org the agency serves.
    -   `Client name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Account owner` (singleCollaborator -- internal AM)
    -   `Tier` (singleSelect: Retainer / Project / On-demand)
    -   `Active` (checkbox)
    -   `Industry` (singleSelect)
    -   `Onboarded date` (date)
    -   `SOW links` (multipleAttachments or URL)
    -   `Retainer hours per period` (number)
    -   `Period` (singleSelect: Monthly / Quarterly / Annual)
    -   `Hours used this period` (rollup from Tasks)
    -   `Hours remaining` (formula)
-   SOWs / Engagements (optional) -- when SOWs change frequently.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Client` (multipleRecordLinks -> Clients)
    -   `Start date` / `End date` (date)
    -   `Deliverables` (multilineText or multipleRecordLinks)
    -   `Hours estimate` / `Hours actual` (number)
    -   `Status` (singleSelect: Draft / Signed / In progress / Closed)

### Campaign / Brief field additions

-   `Client` (multipleRecordLinks -> Clients) on Campaigns, Briefs, Tasks
-   `SLA stage` (singleSelect) -- first concept / pre-production / final / delivered
-   `Hours actual` (number) on Tasks for retainer drawdown

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Client portal interface (one per client OR one with `current user -> their client` filter) -- read-only view of their campaigns + approval queue.
-   Retainer drawdown view -- Clients with hours used vs retained, color-coded.
-   Account-manager dashboard -- Clients owned by current user with current campaign status.
-   New-client onboarding form -- captures client metadata and creates Campaigns table records.

## Lightweight marketing CRM (niche -- surface on demand)

Airtable can BE the lightweight marketing CRM for moderate contact volumes when the user has no existing Salesforce / HubSpot CRM, or for marketing-only contact tracking sitting in front of an existing sales-side CRM. Typed contact fields + segments + linked-record account hierarchy + automations cover the marketing-side job. Surface this shape when the user uses _"contact tracker,"_ _"prospect list,"_ _"marketing CRM,"_ _"lifecycle marketing without Salesforce,"_ _"warm leads list,"_ or describes a contact-management need without an existing CRM. Don't push specialized vertical CRMs unless contact volume exceeds what Airtable's relational model handles cleanly (typically tens-of-thousands of contacts plus heavy query workload) or the user explicitly asks.

### Tables added on top of the small or mid shape

-   Contacts -- the central record.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Email` (email)
    -   `Phone` (phone)
    -   `Company` (multipleRecordLinks -> Accounts, or singleLineText for unmapped)
    -   `Title` (singleLineText)
    -   `Lifecycle stage` (singleSelect: Lead / MQL / SQL / Customer / Lost / Dormant) -- adapt naming to the user's funnel
    -   `Source` (singleSelect: Inbound form / Event / Webinar / Outbound / Referral / Other)
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator) -- assigned marketer / SDR
    -   `Segments` (multipleRecordLinks -> Segments) -- for campaign targeting
    -   `Linked campaigns` (multipleRecordLinks -> Campaigns) -- historical engagement
    -   `Engagement score` (formula or AI field) -- rolled up from event / campaign / email touches
    -   `Created` (createdTime), `Last touched` (lastModifiedTime)
    -   `Notes` (multilineText) -- free-form rep notes
    -   `AI lifecycle suggestion` (AI field) -- recommends a lifecycle stage transition based on recent activity; human marketer approves before transition.
-   Segments -- saved audience definitions.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Criteria` (multilineText) -- the segmentation logic in plain English
    -   `Linked contacts` (multipleRecordLinks -> Contacts) -- manually curated OR maintained via automation
    -   `Owner` (singleCollaborator)
    -   `Linked campaigns` (multipleRecordLinks -> Campaigns)
-   Accounts (optional -- when B2B) -- the company-level record contacts roll up to.
    -   `Account name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Industry` (singleSelect)
    -   `Size` (singleSelect: 1-10 / 10-50 / 50-200 / 200-1000 / 1000+)
    -   `Linked contacts` (multipleRecordLinks -> Contacts)
    -   `Account owner` (singleCollaborator)

### When to push toward a dedicated CRM instead

-   Contact volume above ~10-50K records (Airtable's relational model slows on heavy query workload at that scale; the dedicated CRM's indexes matter).
-   The user already has Salesforce / HubSpot CRM -- sync airtable-marketing-ops contacts to it; don't build a parallel layer.
-   Sales already lives in a CRM -- marketing needs to play nice with their pipeline data; sync rather than fork.
-   Heavy automation needs around contact state transitions (lifecycle, lead scoring, lifecycle workflows) -- MAPs / CRMs do this with battle-tested infra; Airtable's automations cover lighter needs.

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Lifecycle Kanban view on Contacts grouped by Lifecycle stage (the lead-to-customer pipeline view).
-   Gallery view on Contacts cover-image = company logo or contact photo (for relationship-mapping views).
-   Form view on a "Lead submission" or "Event sign-up" intake.
-   Interface page: Account 360 -- Account with linked Contacts, linked Campaigns, recent engagement timeline.
-   Sync into the user's MAP for actual email sends; Airtable holds the audience definition, MAP holds the send infrastructure.

## Choosing between shapes

If the answers to the scope questions don't obviously map to one shape, lean smaller -- it's easier to add tables than to strip them. The MCP can extend the schema cleanly as the team grows; over-scaffolding a 10-table base for a single marketer creates clutter and abandoned views.

When in doubt:

-   Default to lightweight (2-3 table) for solo marketers, music releases, book publicity, very small agencies.
-   Default to small (3-4 table) for in-house teams under 10 with basic campaign tracking needs.
-   Default to mid (5-6 table) for 10-50 person marketing orgs with creative ops + audience modeling.
-   Default to large (7-8 table) for 50+ person marketing orgs with multi-channel + approval + budget needs.
-   Default to enterprise / multi-brand only when the user has multiple sub-brands or multi-region complexity.
-   Surface regulated only when the user uses MLR / compliance / claim-validation vocabulary or operates in alcohol / pharma / finance / insurance / lottery / healthcare.
-   Surface agency multi-client only when the user explicitly serves external clients OR runs an in-house agency.
-   Surface lightweight marketing CRM when the user describes contact / prospect / lifecycle tracking without naming an existing CRM, or explicitly says they want marketing CRM functionality but don't have Salesforce / HubSpot.

The user can always ask for more tables; pushing all 10 on a 5-person team is overcorrection.
